But as new clusters threaten to break out, local authorities elsewhere have responded by toughening the rules on face masks too. There are now eight regions in Italy where you have to wear a face mask at all times in public: Lazio, Lombardy, Sicily, Campania, Calabria, Marche, Piedmont, Basilicata. Some cities, including Genoa, have also enforced similar rules. Rome and the entire Lazio region on Friday ordered that masks must be worn in public at all times after a spike in cases locally."},{"name":"China","country_name":"CHN","country_code":156,"who_category":"other measures","who_subcategory":null,"who_measure":"Financial packages","targeted":"Small and medium enterprises","comments":"Approval of a new loan guarantee commitment of $20 billion under the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau to introduce a new Special 100 per cent Guarantee Product under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.

The decree also suspends nightclubs and outdoor nightclubs. The government fears that nightlife, which is in full swing during the \"Ferragosto\" (the sacrosanct weekend of 15 August), would contribute to the exploding contamination. The regions were divided. Calabria has ordered the closure of all dance venues. Sardinia has kept everything open. In between, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna have stepped up inspections.

Students will not need to wear masks at their desks so long as they maintain interpersonal distance of one metre, according to the technical scientific committee advising the Italian government on covid-19 protocols. Face masks will however be obligatory for all children over the age of six when they move around the school building, except for gym class, eating in canteens and answering a teacher. Italy's transport ministry has approved protocols stipulating that school buses and public transport carrying students must operate at a maximum of 80 per cent capacity. Italy has also delivered 2.4 million single-use desks - for social distancing reasons - with plans to hand out millions of masks along with 170,000 litres of hand sanitiser each week. Schools have been allowed to reopen. In case of positive cases inside the schools, the local health authority (ASL) will then make a decision on what needs to be closed - whether this is just one class or the entire school.

In secondary schools, this applies to all pupils, regardless of their age.  * In secondary vocational education (MBO) and higher education, all students should stay 1.5 metres apart, regardless of their age;  * Since adults play a greater role in the spread of the novel coronavirus, teachers need to stay 1.5 metres apart from others whenever possible.  Some schools are requiring older students to wear masks in corridors due to lack of space. Schools are also being urged to make sure that they have proper ventilation.

Japan on 19 September relaxed a rule limiting the size of crowds at professional sports matches, movie theaters and other events, in yet another sign of a gradual return to social and economic activities at pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. Both Nippon Professional Baseball and soccer's J-League held matches with over 10,000 spectators after the government lifted the 5,000-person cap on large events, allowing the sporting bodies to hold them with up to 50 percent capacity. Amid signs of a recent plateauing in nationwide coronavirus cases, the 50 percent attendance cap has been fully scrapped for small cinemas and theaters deemed to have low infection risk. T Joy Co., which operates around 20 cinema complexes across Japan, and numerous mini theaters began allowing all seats at venues to be booked from first screenings on 19 September. But major movie theater chains Toho Cinemas and Aeon Cinema, as well as operators of live stage shows and concerts, have decided to keep the 50 percent restriction in place for the time being. The government will decide whether to keep the attendance rule in place beyond November after reviewing the novel coronavirus and seasonal influenza infection trends, according to officials.

Main points include: 1) Those who are in home isolation or quarantine and are asymptomatic may submit a request to the local health authority on or after the fifth day of home isolation or quarantine period. 2) After a request is approved and the hospital has consented to the individuals request, the local health authority will arrange for the individual to be tested at a designated healthcare facility at the individuals own expense.3) Within three days after the individuals test result comes back negative, the individual may, with the hospitals consent, go out to visit a patient or may attend or organize a funeral for which the duration may not exceed two hours at a time (travel time between locations excluded). Moreover, the individual may only go out for the reasons mentioned above once every day.4) The individual must wear a face mask at all times when going out and must maintain social distancing.

As Beijing lowered its emergency response to COVID-19 from level II to III, the city's Municipal Bureau of Sports on 21 July issued new guidelines for the reopening of sports and fitness venues. According to the notice, sports events will not be held in middle and high risk level areas. Low-risk areas are allowed to hold sports events with fewer than 500 participants, including organizers and spectators. Sports events with more than 500 participants must be reviewed and evaluated by the local government under the epidemic prevention and control mechanism. The guidelines also include a capacity limit of 50 percent, and require customers to limit their exercise time to two hours, show their health code and measure body temperature at the entrance, and maintain social distancing inside the facilities. The Bureau added that a safe social distance for swimming, skating and rollerskating is not less than five square meters, and that of other indoor sports is not less than four square meters, adding regular disinfection measures should be undertaken frequently in all areas, including toilets and public shower rooms. Also, a number of parks and tourist sites have reopened their indoor exhibition halls to visitors, according to a report of chinanews.com. Measures have been put in place to prevent the epidemic. The limit for tourist numbers has been raised from 30 percent of capacity to 50 percent in these tourist sites. Before entering indoor areas, visitors are required to have their temperature checked and show \"green\" QR codes on their mobile phones  which serve as a proof of good health. After going into the indoor areas, tourists should wear a mask and keep a distance of no less than 1 meter from each other. Tourists are also required to wear a mask in crowded and closed places. Despite the reopening of the tourist spots, officials of the city government warned that it is too early to relax vigilance."},{"name":"India","country_name":"IND","country_code":356,"who_category":"Social and physical distancing measures","who_subcategory":"Domestic travel","who_measure":"Stay-at-home order","targeted":"Partial curfew","comments":"people are required to stay at home, they should not travel unnecessary and they should not shake hand or hug people while greeting."},{"name":"India","country_name":"IND","country_code":356,"who_category":"other measures","who_subcategory":"Communications and engagement","who_measure":"General public awareness campaigns","targeted":null,"comments":"a dash board about COVID-19 situation in KDMC area is now available in public domain.

This is in line with recommendations from the Chief Epidemiologist. The aim of the move is to encourage people to be tested rather than to commit to a period in quarantine, so reducing the likelihood that they will bring the infection with them into the country. The matter was discussed and approved at a cabinet meeting on 17 November.In his memo to the minister, the Chief Epidemiologist expressed his concern that the recent escalation in the spread of the pandemic abroad will increase the risk of imported infection if travellers choose quarantine but then fail to observe the rules in full. There have been many cases where suspicion regarding the emergence of new infections in Iceland has involved tourists who have only intended to spend short periods in Iceland.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)  Bars and cafes in the most densely populated regions of the Netherlands will have to close their doors earlier from Sunday as the country begins reimposing restrictions to battle sharply rising infection rates, particularly among students and people in their 20s, the government announced Friday. The coronavirus is making a comeback, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a nationally televised news conference and warned that more measures may be necessary if infection rates dont start falling again soon . As well as the early closing  at 1 a.m.  of hospitality establishments, Rutte said that any gatherings of more than 50 people will now have to apply for a permit from local authorities. The restrictions apply in six regions mostly in the densely populated west of the country and authorities in those regions also will likely introduce other local measures. The regions affected include the capital, Amsterdam, as well as major cities such as Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Ruttes comments came as the Netherlands has recorded a string of record infection numbers in recent days, reaching 1,977 in the 24 hours to Friday morning.  At the somber news conference, Rutte warned that if the country doesnt manage to get the virus under control, new infections could rise in three weeks to more than 10,000 per day. He urged the country to stick to social distancing and hygiene measures and to work from home as much as possible./ppHospital and intensive care unit admissions remain well below the levels reached during the first peak of the outbreak in March and April, but have been rising over recent weeks. More than 6,250 people are confirmed to have died in the Netherlands since the outbreak began, though the true number is higher because many people who died of suspected COVID-19 werent tested.  If we look at the number of infections, this is the second wave, Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said. But he added: If we look at the situation in hospitals, were not there yet. Together, we have to make sure that it doesnt happen. Jacco Vonhof, head of a small and medium-sized industry lobby group, criticized the decision to impose measures on hospitality establishments already reeling from the economic impact of the outbreak. He called the move to close earlier completely disproportional and warned that drinkers would simply move elsewhere. It will lead to an increase in people gathering at home and at illegal parties after midnight, he warned."},{"name":"China","country_name":"CHN","country_code":156,"who_category":"Social and physical distancing measures","who_subcategory":"School measures","who_measure":"Closing","targeted":"All schools","comments":"A region in DongJiangGang District of Tianjian was classified as high-risk area since Nov. 20.

Under bright blue skies, nearly 2,000 students gathered this month for the start of school at Hanyang No. 1 High School in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged. Medical staff stood guard at school entrances, taking temperatures. Administrative officials reviewed the students travel histories and \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-tests.html\" coronavirus test results. Local \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/business/china-communist-private-business.html\" Communist Party cadres kept watch, making sure teachers followed detailed instructions on hygiene and showed an anti-epidemic spirit. While the Communist Party has adopted many of the same sanitation and distancing procedures used elsewhere, it has rolled them out with a characteristic all-out, command-and-control approach that brooks no dissent. With schools, the governments effort has in some places been met with similar frustrations. Teachers, who are at times doubling as medical workers, checking for fevers and isolating sick students, say they are exhausted by the new protocols. China is introducing many of the same measures as countries in \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/world/europe/germany-schools-virus-reopening.htmlsearchResultPosition3\" Europe and elsewhere where schools have recently reopened. Principals are instructing students and teachers to keep a distance inside classrooms, though seating arrangements remain largely the same. Teachers are trying to keep students separated by grade, assigning specific routes and entrances for different age groups to avoid crowding. Masks are mostly optional inside classrooms for students and staff. But Chinas approach is also much more demanding, as it has been throughout the pandemic. Students and staff in areas where outbreaks had previously been reported, or who had traveled to areas considered risky, were required to show coronavirus test results before the start of school. Education officials have urged students to avoid unnecessary outings aside from going to school, though the rule is unlikely to be enforced. Students are also discouraged from speaking while eating or taking public transportation. Many schools have already had some practice in operating under pandemic conditions. Classes resumed for some grades in April and May in many parts of China, though with staggered schedules and limits on the number of students. Since then, the government has invested heavily in equipping schools with masks, gloves, infrared thermometers and other equipment. The Ministry of Educations guidelines call for temperatures to be taken at least three times a day and reported to school officials. The rules are tighter in areas that the government sees as particularly vulnerable to an outbreak. In Beijing, for example, masks are required at all times."},{"name":"China","country_name":"CHN","country_code":156,"who_category":"International travel measures","who_subcategory":null,"who_measure":"Entry screening and isolation or quarantine","targeted":"borders, freight drivers","comments":"management for drivers of cross-border freight vehicles in response to the rise of imported novel coronavirus cases.

The measures in this package amount to around  11 billion in additional expenditure and  1.5 billion in early investment.

Singapore and Japan will resume cross-border travel for expatriates and businesspeople under two schemes starting in September. Business travellers will be allowed to move and work within a limited area, and will be confined to their accommodations during their first 14 days of stay. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen and Japans foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi have agreed for the two countries to reopen borders for expatriates. Expat arrivals from Cambodia will be granted entry from early September, provided they observe a 14-day self-quarantine period. In addition, Motegi and Prak Sokhonn, Cambodias deputy prime minister, will work towards easing entry restrictions on short-term business travellers. Japan has also agreed to permit entry to Malaysian expatriates within September, with efforts underway to extend entry to students from Malaysia. Following the announcements, Japans largest travel agency, JTB Corporation, has received numerous requests from businesspeople to travel to Singapore, Cambodia and Malaysia, a JTB spokesperson told TTG Asia. Of those inquiries, customers have asked JTB to handle flight tickets, hotel reservations and local tours, he said. While Japans easing of entry restrictions will likely have limited impact on its wider tourism industry, the move is expected to provide some relief to the struggling hotel sector, particularly in major cities. Pre-Covid-19, the South-east Asian markets were growing in importance for Japan. However, in July 2020, the country welcomed a mere 10 arrivals from Singapore, down from 21,716 in the previous corresponding period, while less than 10 people entered Japan from Malaysia, down from 22,957 over the same period the year before.

A vast majority of schools in Latvia on Tuesday reopened their doors to students for in-person learning as the new school year began in the Baltic country. However, education officials and health authorities called for caution, urging both kids and adults to watch their health amid an ongoing, albeit controlled, spread of COVID-19 in Latvia. \"This is a time when everyone has to take responsibility,\" Health and Science Minister Ilga Suplinska said, calling on families to monitor the health of their offspring and not to send kids to school if there are suspicions that they might be unwell. According to a survey conducted by the Latvian Education and Science Ministry and covering 557 comprehensive schools, including private schools, most schools -- or 448 -- have made the necessary arrangements for in-person learning. Meanwhile, distance learning will continue at over 100 high schools in Latvia, the ministry's survey reveals. To prevent the coronavirus from spreading in schools where students are learning in classrooms, each class will be treated as a closed community, so that kids from one class did not meet with pupils from other classes. Since the epidemiological situation in Latvia, just like elsewhere in Europe, can still change, the Education and Science Ministry has worked out three scenarios, of which the first envisages learning in only classrooms, provided that the school can ensure compliance with epidemiological safety standards. The second model involves mixing learning in classrooms with distance learning, and the third model envisages switching completely to distance learning in case of a COVID-19 outbreak in the school.The government has allocated 3.97 million euros (4.7 million U.S. dollars) to provide schoolchildren with the equipment necessary for distance learning like tablet computers and laptops."},{"name":"India","country_name":"IND","country_code":356,"who_category":"Individual measures","who_subcategory":null,"who_measure":"Wearing a mask","targeted":"public spaces","comments":"Masks required in gatherings"},{"name":"Italy","country_name":"ITA","country_code":380,"who_category":"International travel measures","who_subcategory":null,"who_measure":"Restricting entry","targeted":"Multiple countries","comments":"13 countries banned from entry.

The letter from the Chinese authorities requested information related to 12 other meat plants, seeking to find out whether media reports of coronavirus outbreaks in those facilities were true.
